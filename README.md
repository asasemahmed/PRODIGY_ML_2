# PRODIGY_ML_2
# Welcome to the KMeans Clustering Machine Learning Project! This project aims to demonstrate the implementation and usage of KMeans clustering algorithm for data clustering tasks. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions on how to use it effectively.

# Introduction
KMeans clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering unlabeled data. It partitions data into k clusters based on similarity, where each cluster is represented by its centroid. It's widely used in various applications including customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.

This project provides a simple implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

# Usage
To use the KMeans clustering algorithm in your own projects, you can follow these steps:

Prepare Data: Ensure that your data is properly formatted and preprocessed. KMeans clustering works with numerical data, so ensure your data is in the appropriate format.

Instantiate KMeans: Create an instance of the KMeans class from scikit-learn, specifying the number of clusters (k) you want to identify.

Fit Data: Fit your data to the KMeans model using the fit() method. This will compute the cluster centroids.

Predict Clusters: Use the predict() method to assign each data point to a cluster based on the computed centroids.

Analyze Results: Analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights into your data. You can visualize the clusters and centroids to understand the underlying patterns.
